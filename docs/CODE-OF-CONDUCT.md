Dear contributor, if you're reading this I assume you probably want to know which are the rules to be a part of this proyect. While I could simply take the effortless path of searching for a template online as suggested by Github here https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project, I refuse to mimic suggested community rules which were clearly designed by relativist individuals who sadly lack the philosophical knowledge required to accurately direct their moral compasses due to the fact they consider impossible to achieve objetive certainty, in other words, they decide to willingly ignore immanent reality in favor of a false illusion of pursuing "equality" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism, this is the sad, final result of the liquidized society we've been experiencing since the dawn of the 21st century https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_modernity. 

## The story of Microsoft and the Master branch

After the recent acquisition of Github by Microsoft in 2018 some things changed for the platform, but I would like you to focus your attention on this peculiar change, the story of the Master branch, as I've labeled it. https://www.theserverside.com/feature/Why-GitHub-renamed-its-master-branch-to-main in this article Github's staff explains the usually unnoticed context of the decision, here we can spot 2 interesting facts, firstly, we see a tasteless extrapolation of America's social unrest in 2020 to the rest of the World https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932022_United_States_racial_unrest. This action is also a contradiction for Github proclaims to serve developers from all around the world, not just the US, so I must pose the question...why did the Github team considered fair pushing such a significant name change for everyone on the whole planet if said problem happened exclusively in the US? cultural marxism arises as the preferred answer.

Secondly, there is a close correlation between relativism and anarchy, for the lack of absolute moral values is the inherent cause responsible for ignoring objetive, physical and biological reality, it undermines perception and strives to destroy the true meaning of the words, the oldest tactic of moral Relativism and Nihilism to achieve control, nowadays reincarnated under the name "deconstruction". In the matter at hand, and unsurprisingly being forced to highlight something obvious, the use of the term "Master" branch in Github is perfectly fine because it objectively refers to a system of communication between two processes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master/slave_(technology), the social context of the US shouldn't have a direct impact on Technology since the inherent nature of any science is technical, not social, because any Science is based upon abstract reasoning, not emotional impulsivity, which is the case for Art instead. 

Due to the aforementioned arguments, this change is an insult to those who back in the day, dedicated their whole lives to gift Humanity with the incredible inventions we lightly take for granted nowadays. So go ahead and honour their legacy by calling your defaut branch Master as you've always done so its name holds true meaning.

## General Guidelines of this proyect:

1 - Please send your contributions to my Develop branch, in which I'll review and incorporate them to the Master branch upon examination.

2 - Mandatory use of the provided Template for all of your Pull Requests.

3 - Real freedom of expression based on Philosophical Realism rather than Relativism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism.

4 - Avoidance of pandering.

5 - Politeness and courtesy are always welcome.
